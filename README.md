üåê Multilingual Voice Translation System

This project enables real-time voice translation and cloning, allowing users to speak in Indian regional languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil, Telugu) and get the output as English text and audio in the same cloned voice.

It leverages OpenAI Whisper for multilingual speech-to-text translation and Real-Time Voice Cloning for generating natural-sounding English speech in the original speaker‚Äôs voice.

üöÄ Features

 Input speech in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, and other Indian languages
 Automatic transcription and translation into English text
 Generate English audio output with cloned voice
 Real-time performance with Whisper + Voice Cloning
 Easy to extend for more languages

     choco install ffmpeg
     ```
   - Windows using Scoop:
     ```bash
     scoop install ffmpeg
     ```

6. **Download Cloning Models:**
   Download the following files and save them in the specified directory within the cloned repository:
   - [encoder.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q8mEGwCkFy23KZsinbuvdKAQLqNKbYf1/view) (save in `saved_models/default/encoder.pt`)
   - [synthesizer.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EqFMIbvxffxtjiVrtykroF6_mUh-5Z3s/view) (save in `saved_models/default/synthesizer.pt`)
   - [vocoder.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cf2NO6FtI0jDuy8AV3Xgn6leO6dHjIgu/view) (save in `saved_models/default/vocoder.pt`)

7. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash

In the above output, the input audio wzs recorded in Tamil and output is got with English


#### Usage

- This project currently supports Indian regional languages. To add more languages, check available options using:
  ```bash
  whisper -h
  ```

- By default, the project uses the "whisper small" model. Modify the `model` variable in `main.py` to change the model.
